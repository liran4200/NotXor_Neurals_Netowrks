# NotXor_Neurals_Netowrks

 This project creates logistic neural network implementation using Tensorflow.   
 
 Do 8(2^8) experiment with different parameters  
 - learning rate 0.1, 0.01                       
 - number of hidden nodes 4, 2                   
 - with bridge and without bridge 
 
 And computes NotXor(IFF) function with training,
 Using Gradient Descent and Cross Entropy loss
